# How to Save £1,000 on Taxes as a UK Freelancer

Freelancers in the UK often pay more tax than they should — simply because they miss out on deductions or fail to plan ahead.  
Here are straightforward ways to cut your tax bill this year.

## 1. Claim All Your Allowable Expenses
Home office costs, software, equipment, and professional subscriptions are all deductible.  
Missing even small monthly costs adds up to hundreds over a year.

## 2. Track Mileage and Travel
Business trips, client visits, or even mileage allowances (45p per mile) are easy wins.  
Don’t rely on memory — log them.

## 3. Deduct Training and Courses
If training keeps your current skills sharp, it’s deductible. Example: upgrading design or coding skills.

## 4. Use the Simplified Home Office Rate
If you work from home 25+ hours per month, you can claim flat-rate home working expenses.  
It’s simpler than calculating bills, but still saves money.

## 5. File and Pay Early
Filing early avoids late fees and gives time to budget for tax.  
Paying early sometimes reduces “payment on account” surprises.
