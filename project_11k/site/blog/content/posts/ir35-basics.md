IR35 affects certain contractor engagements. Hereâ€™s what to understand at a high level.

## Core idea
- It tests whether a contractor is effectively an employee.
- Status depends on control, substitution, and mutuality of obligation.

## Implications
- Inside IR35 changes tax treatment and take-home.
- Outside IR35 allows normal contractor taxation.

## Actions
- Review contracts for status indicators.
- Keep evidence of substitution and control where applicable.
- Use status tools and get independent advice for edge cases.
