IR35 is a set of tax rules for contractors working through limited companies. It tests if youâ€™re really self-employed or an employee.

## Key tests
- **Control**: who decides how and when you work.
- **Substitution**: can you send someone else.
- **Mutuality of obligation**: is there guaranteed work and pay.

## Why it matters
- Inside IR35: taxed like an employee, less take-home pay.
- Outside IR35: normal contractor tax rules apply.

## Example
If you work full-time at one client, same hours as staff, no substitution, HMRC may class you inside IR35.

## Actions
- Review contracts.
- Use HMRC CEST tool.
- Get professional review if turnover is high.
- Keep evidence of independence.

## Checklist
- [ ] Written contracts reviewed.
- [ ] Records of multiple clients if possible.
- [ ] Proof of substitution rights.
- [ ] Seek advice before disputes.
