This guide explains what “allowances” and “reliefs” mean for UK freelancers, the common ones you can use, and how to avoid basic mistakes.

## Key ideas
- Allowances reduce taxable income or tax due.
- You can claim either simplified expenses or actual costs where allowed.
- Keep evidence for every claim.

## Common allowances
- Personal Allowance: standard threshold before you pay Income Tax.
- Trading Allowance: small allowance for casual income, not for limited companies.
- Capital Allowances: claim depreciation via Annual Investment Allowance where applicable.
- Home Office: apportion costs or use simplified rates.
- Business Mileage: HMRC approved mileage rates or actual costs.

## Records
- Keep receipts, invoices, and statements.
- Record purpose, date, and amount for each claim.
- Store digitally with backups.

## Next steps
- List monthly costs and tag each as personal or business.
- Pick simplified vs actual for home and vehicle and stay consistent.
- Reconcile quarterly so filings are easy.
