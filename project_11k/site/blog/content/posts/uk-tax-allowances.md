As a freelancer in the UK, you’re taxed just like any other self-employed business. That means you can claim a range of allowances that reduce the amount of income subject to tax. Understanding them — and keeping the right records — can make the difference between an unnecessary tax bill and money in your pocket.

## The Big Three
**1. Personal Allowance**  
Everyone gets a tax-free allowance each year before paying Income Tax (currently £12,570 for most people). If your total income is below this, you won’t pay tax at all.

**2. Trading Allowance**  
If your freelance income is £1,000 or less, you don’t even need to register. For larger incomes, you can deduct either £1,000 automatically or your actual expenses (but not both).

**3. Capital Allowances**  
Instead of “depreciating” assets, the UK system lets you deduct some or all of the cost up front. The Annual Investment Allowance usually covers laptops, desks, and other equipment.

## Home and Travel
- **Home Office:** Either claim a flat rate based on hours worked at home or apportion actual bills (utilities, broadband, rent).  
- **Mileage:** Use HMRC’s approved mileage rates (45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles, 25p thereafter) or claim actual vehicle costs.

## Example Walkthrough
Anna, a freelance designer, earns £40,000:  
- Personal Allowance: £12,570 tax-free.  
- Expenses: £6,000 actual costs.  
- Taxable income: £21,430.  
She saves over £1,200 in tax compared to not claiming allowances.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to log mileage or apportion bills.  
- Mixing personal and business accounts, making it hard to separate costs.  
- Double-claiming: you must pick *either* the trading allowance or actual expenses.

## Checklist
- [ ] Keep a digital folder for receipts each month.  
- [ ] Record mileage with date, purpose, and distance.  
- [ ] Review whether simplified or actual costs save more.  
- [ ] Reconcile income and expenses quarterly.

**Bottom line:** UK tax allowances are there to make sure freelancers only pay tax on true profit. Claim them consistently and you’ll avoid overpaying HMRC.
