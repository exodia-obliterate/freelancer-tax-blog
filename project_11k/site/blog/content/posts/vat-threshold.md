Understand when VAT registration triggers and what it means for pricing, invoicing, and cashflow.

## When to register
- Track rolling 12-month taxable turnover.
- Register promptly when you exceed the threshold.
- Consider voluntary registration if clients are VAT-registered.

## Pricing and invoices
- Add VAT to your net prices after registration.
- Include required fields on invoices: VAT number, rate, amount, totals.

## Schemes
- Flat Rate Scheme can simplify accounting but compare effective rates.
- Cash accounting helps align VAT with actual receipts.

## Practical steps
- Start tracking turnover monthly.
- Decide pricing including VAT impact before registering.
- Communicate changes to clients in advance.
