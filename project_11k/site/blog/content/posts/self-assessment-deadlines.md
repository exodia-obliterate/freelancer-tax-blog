## Core dates

- Paper returns due in October.
- Online returns due in January.
- Balancing payment and first payment on account due in January.
- Second payment on account due in July.

## Penalties
- Fixed late filing penalty after the deadline.
- Daily penalties after a period.
- Late payment interest accrues until full payment.

## If you’re late
- File as soon as possible to stop penalties escalating.
- Set up a Time to Pay plan if needed.
- Keep proof of reasonable excuse if you have one.

## Checklist
- Diary reminders three months ahead.
