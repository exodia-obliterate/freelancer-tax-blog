Deadlines matter more than perfect spreadsheets. Miss one and HMRC adds penalties fast. Here’s what you must know as a UK freelancer.

## Core dates
- **5 October**: register for Self Assessment after starting to trade.
- **31 October**: deadline for paper returns.
- **31 January**: online returns due + balancing payment + first payment on account.
- **31 July**: second payment on account.

## Penalties
- £100 fixed penalty after 31 January.
- Daily penalties start after 3 months.
- Further fines at 6 and 12 months.
- Late payment interest runs until cleared.

## Example
James misses the January deadline. He files in April. That’s £100 fixed + £10/day for 90 days = £900. Total £1,000 for being late.

## Checklist
- [ ] Mark deadlines in calendar.
- [ ] Save money monthly to cover bills.
- [ ] File early; amend later if needed.
- [ ] Use HMRC reminders via text/email.
