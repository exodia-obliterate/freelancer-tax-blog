When you start freelancing in the UK you must register as self-employed with HMRC. It’s free, online, and essential.

## Steps
- Create a Government Gateway account.
- Use HMRC’s online form to register as self-employed.
- Wait for your UTR (Unique Taxpayer Reference) to arrive.
- Keep HMRC letters safe — they contain your login info.

## Tips
- Register by 5 October in your business’s second tax year.
- Keep a note of your UTR and Government Gateway ID separately.
