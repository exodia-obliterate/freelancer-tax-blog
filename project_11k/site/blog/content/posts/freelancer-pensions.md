Freelancers donâ€™t get auto-enrolled into pensions. But contributions save tax now and build for later.

## Why it matters
- Contributions reduce taxable income.
- Government adds tax relief to your contributions.

## Options
- Personal pension (SIPP).
- Stakeholder pension.
- Lifetime ISA for under 40s.

## Steps
- Set up a monthly contribution, even small.
- Review annually.
