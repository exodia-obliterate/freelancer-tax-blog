You file your return, HMRC tells you what you owe, then you pay. Simple â€” but the methods matter.

## Methods
- Online banking or debit card.
- Direct debit.
- At bank or Post Office (fewer options now).
- By phone.

## Deadlines
- 31 January: balancing payment + first payment on account.
- 31 July: second payment on account.

## Tips
- Pay a few days early to clear through banks.
- Set up Time to Pay if struggling.
