# Introduction

If you’re freelancing in the UK, tax is one of the biggest headaches.  
The rules are confusing, HMRC guidance is written in jargon, and mistakes can cost you hundreds of pounds in penalties or missed deductions.  

This guide is designed to cut through the noise.  
It’s **plain-English, practical, and focused only on what freelancers actually need to know**.  

By the end, you’ll understand:
- How to register for and file a Self-Assessment tax return.  
- What you can (and can’t) claim as expenses.  
- Whether VAT applies to you — and how to handle it if it does.  
- Simple bookkeeping routines that save hours.  
- Key deadlines for 2025/26 (so you never miss one again).  

You’ll also get plug-and-play tools:

# Chapter 1 — Getting Started

## Do You Need to Register for Self-Assessment?

If you earn money outside of PAYE employment (e.g. freelancing, side hustles, contracting), you almost certainly need to register with HMRC for Self-Assessment.  

You **must register** if:
- You earned over £1,000 from self-employment in the last tax year.  
- You need to pay Class 2 or Class 4 National Insurance.  
- You earned income from abroad.  
- You need to declare untaxed income (crypto, rent, etc.).  

> **Deadline:** For the 2024/25 tax year, you must register by **5 October 2025**.

## How to Register (Step-by-Step)

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment).  
2. Create a Government Gateway ID (if you don’t already have one).  
3. Submit your details (name, address, National Insurance number).  
4. HMRC will send you a **Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)** by post.  
5. Once your UTR is active, you can log in and file returns online.  

> Tip: Apply **early**. The UTR letter often takes 10–14 days to arrive.

# Chapter 2 — VAT Basics

## Do You Need to Register?

As of 2025, the **VAT registration threshold is £90,000** in turnover over a rolling 12-month period.  

- If your total self-employed income exceeds this, you **must register**.  
- If you’re below this, you can choose **voluntary registration** (sometimes useful if clients are VAT-registered).  

### VAT Schemes for Freelancers
- **Standard VAT Scheme** — charge 20%, reclaim VAT on expenses.  
- **Flat Rate Scheme (FRS)** — pay a fixed % of turnover (simpler, often cheaper for service businesses).

# Chapter 3 — Allowable Expenses

## What You Can Claim

HMRC allows freelancers to deduct business expenses before tax.  
Common categories include:

- **Home office costs** — rent, utilities (proportional).  
- **Equipment & software** — laptops, subscriptions (e.g. Adobe, Notion).  
- **Travel** — trains, buses, mileage allowance.  
- **Professional costs** — accountants, training, insurance.  
- **Marketing** — website hosting, ads, design services.  

> Rule of thumb: **If it’s “wholly and exclusively” for business, it’s deductible.**

## Expenses You Cannot Claim

- Personal clothing (unless protective or branded uniform).  
- Daily lunches (unless on business travel).  
- Fines or penalties (e.g. speeding tickets).
