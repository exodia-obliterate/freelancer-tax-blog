# Top 10 Freelancer Tax Mistakes in the UK (2025 Edition)

If you’re freelancing in the UK, tax can feel overwhelming.  
Here are the most common mistakes freelancers make — and how you can avoid them.

## 1. Missing the Registration Deadline
If you started freelancing in the 2024/25 tax year, you must register for Self-Assessment by **5 October 2025**. Miss it, and you risk penalties.

## 2. Forgetting to Track Small Expenses
Coffee on client meetings, domain renewals, mileage — these add up.  
Not tracking them means paying more tax than necessary.

## 3. Ignoring VAT Threshold
As of 2025, the VAT threshold is **£90,000 turnover**. Forgetting to register = fines.

## 4. Not Backing Up Records
Receipts fade. Keep digital backups in cloud storage.

## 5. Mixing Personal & Business Accounts
Use a separate bank account. HMRC will thank you later.

## 6. Missing Payment on Account
If your bill is over £1,000, HMRC may expect advance payments. Plan for it.

## 7. Guessing Allowable Expenses
Claim only what’s “wholly and exclusively” for business. Grey areas? Keep a note.

## 8. Using Outdated Templates
Invoices need legal info. Use updated templates (like the ones in our **Freelancer Tax Survival Kit 2025**).

## 9. Leaving Filing to the Last Minute
January is chaos. File early to spot issues in time.

## 10. Not Getting Professional Help When Needed
Even if you DIY, a quick check with an accountant can save thousands.
